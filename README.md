Etch-a-Sketch Project for The Odin Project

What I learned:
 - How to work with form objects (Buttons and Selects)
 - More EventListeners (mouseover, mouseoff)
 - Changing CSS styles via Javascript

What I need to do:
 - Get better at working with RGB values through Javascript
 - Code the option task of shading in a square with 10% of black every click
 - Bug: when selecting a new color, deletes squares because bg gets turned to alpha of 0
        -probably just need to reset the board completely
